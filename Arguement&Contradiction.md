Development of diaclectic idealism is almost 3,000 years process. Lead by different biological life circles who deem 
every aspect of life can be diagnosed by their doctrine. 
 
That is crazy but who cares? Why i do care? I belived in dialectic materialism many years. That's why!

I am raised in cominist family which i regret after i truely believe in evolution. 
I would say "i believe evolution" when i was a cominist too but,
it was just an arguement to point out life can happen without the gods.
An arguement to break teocrotical ideas thus their belief finds ground to deploy.

I read about python language lore so I took a look at Monty Python. I find 'arguement' video very interesting.
It is perfect summary of dialectic imao.
